==TODO==


==GENERAL PIRE ===

* Use local memory in reduce kernels instead of global

* Control group/workitem size (Discuss w/ Joel)

* remove unnecessary initialization of (result) arrays.


===FELDSPIRE===

* Function calls (Added Ctor in Expr along with Show instance. What else?)

* Might require "modules". But we shall try without first - attempt to simply
  make a connection between PIRE and Block (in Representation.hs).

===OBSPIRE==

* Talk to Joel


===LOW PRIO / NOPE===

* Shallow embedding of different parallel scan types (Brent-Kung, Sklansky..)
